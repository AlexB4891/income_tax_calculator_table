## Gastos personales

Individuals will enjoy a rebate on income tax caused by their personal expenses, applicable before allocating tax credits to which they are entitled in accordance with the Law. According to Ecuadorian regulations, taxpayers may deduct their personal expenses in six items for 2022: Health; Education, art and culture; Clothing; Food; Housing; and Domestic tourism.

In order to establish the maximum amount of the rebate mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the following rules must be observed (National Assembly of Ecuador, 2004; last amendment 2022):

a)  If your annual gross income (including exempt income) does not exceed two point thirteen (2.13) basic income tax deductible fractions, the maximum amount of the personal expense allowance will be the amount resulting from applying the following formula:

$$R= L \times 20%$$

Where:

$R:$ personal expense allowance

$L:$ The lesser of the declared personal expenses for the annual tax period and the value of the basic food basket multiplied by seven.

b)  If your annual gross income (including exempt income) exceeds two point thirteen (2.13) basic fractions deducted from income tax during the fiscal year:

$$R= L \times 10%$$

$R:$ personal expense allowance

$L:$ The lesser of the declared personal expenses for the annual tax period and the value of the basic food basket multiplied by seven.

For purposes of this calculation, the value of the Basic Family Basket as of December of the fiscal year in which the tax is paid, according to the data published by the National Institute of Statistics and Census, shall be considered.

**Personal expenses must be supported by validly issued sales receipts.**

To quantify personal expenses, those incurred by the parents, spouse or common-law partner and dependent children of the taxpayer or his/her spouse or common-law partner may be considered, provided that they do not receive taxable income; however, in any case, VAT and ECI must be excluded from the transactions.
